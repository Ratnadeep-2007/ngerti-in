## The Problem

YouTube is the world's largest classroom — but it's designed to distract, not teach.

- One scroll, one recommendation, and your 60-minute tutorial becomes a 3-hour rabbit hole
- Every detour costs 15–30 minutes of "re-entry tax" just to get back on track
- For 800M+ non-native English speakers, there's **no comprehension layer** — just passive watching and hoping it sticks

## The Solution

**LingoLearn** turns passive YouTube watching into active, **quiz-driven learning**.

Paste a URL → AI generates quizzes → You learn → You earn certificates

**Everything translates instantly into 130+ languages** using the Lingo.dev SDK.

**Passive watching becomes something you can actually prove.**

## Platform Flow & Architecture

### User Journey
![Platform Flow](https://github.com/Prateek1771/LingoLearn/raw/main/public/platform_flow.png?raw=true)

### Video Processing Pipeline
![Video Logic](https://github.com/Prateek1771/LingoLearn/raw/main/public/Video_logic.png?raw=true)

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

```
1. Paste a YouTube URL
2. Choose your target language (130+ options)
3. Pick a learning mode (Jolly or Focus) and a companion
4. AI extracts the transcript and generates quizzes at topic breakpoints
5. Watch the video — quizzes pop up at natural breaks
6. Pass quizzes to continue, retry with different questions if you miss
7. Complete the final quiz to earn your certificate
```

### Under the Hood

```
YouTube URL → Transcript Extraction (InnerTube API)
           → Language Detection (Lingo.dev SDK)
           → Quiz Generation (Groq AI / LLaMA 3.3-70b)
           → Content Translation (Lingo.dev SDK)
           → Interactive Learning Session
           → Certificate Generation (html2canvas + jsPDF)
```

## API Routes

### `POST /api/extract-transcript`
Extracts transcript and metadata from any YouTube URL using the InnerTube API.

### `POST /api/generate-quizzes`
Sends transcript chunks to Groq AI (LLaMA 3.3-70b) to generate breakpoints with primary and retry quiz questions.

### `POST /api/translate`
Translates all content (transcript, quizzes, companion dialogue, certificate labels) via Lingo.dev SDK with batched parallel processing.

### `POST /api/ui-translate`
Translates UI strings with a 3-tier strategy: bundled translations (instant) → localStorage cache → dynamic API (Groq/Lingo.dev).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com)
- [Lingo.dev API Key](https://lingo.dev)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Prateek1771/LingoLearn.git
cd LingoLearn

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with these values:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY=your_lingodotdev_api_key
LINGODOTDEV_ENGINE_ID=your_lingodotdev_engine_id
```

Lingo.dev uses both values:

- `LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY` authenticates the SDK
- `LINGODOTDEV_ENGINE_ID` selects the translation engine for this project

If you are starting fresh, create the key and engine in your Lingo.dev account, then paste them into `.env.local` or `.env`.

The app reads `LINGODOTDEV_ENGINE_ID` automatically when it is present, and otherwise uses the SDK's default engine selection.

### Run

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start learning.

## Quiz Frequency Algorithm

Quizzes adapt to video length:

| Video Duration | Breakpoints | Questions per Breakpoint |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| < 10 min | 2 | 2 |
| 10–30 min | 3–4 | 2 |
| 30–60 min | 4–6 | 3 |
| 60–120 min | 6–8 | 3 |
| > 120 min | 8–10 (capped) | 3 |

Quizzes for the first 20 minutes are generated upfront. Remaining quizzes are lazily prefetched in the background as you watch.

---

## Language Support

**130+ languages** organized across 9 regions:

- **Popular** — English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, and more
- **European** — Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Czech, Hungarian, Greek, Swedish, and 30+ others
- **South Asian** — Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Malayalam, and more
- **East & Southeast Asian** — Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Tagalog, Khmer, and more
- **Middle Eastern** — Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, Kurdish (with full RTL support)
- **African** — Swahili, Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, and 15+ others
- **Americas & Pacific** — Regional variants, Hawaiian, Maori, and more
- **Constructed** — Esperanto, Latin, Sanskrit

RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian, etc.) are auto-detected and the entire UI flips direction accordingly.

---

## Design

- **Dark/Light themes** with CSS variable system and glassmorphism panels
- **Pixel-art aesthetic** — VT323 font, chunky borders, retro animations
- **Responsive** — Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessible** — Keyboard navigation, adjustable subtitle settings

---

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No backend database | Fully client-side with localStorage — zero setup, instant demo |
| Raw HTTPS for YouTube | Bypasses Next.js fetch patching for reliable transcript extraction |
| Chunked translation | Avoids payload-too-large errors from Lingo.dev API |
| Lazy quiz prefetch | Quizzes generated in background after initial segment loads |
| Fallback translations | Session creation succeeds even if translation partially fails |
| Adaptive quiz frequency | Prevents quiz fatigue on long videos while maintaining engagement on short ones |
